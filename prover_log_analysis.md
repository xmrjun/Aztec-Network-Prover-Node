# Prover Log Analysis

## Overview
These logs show the operation of a blockchain prover system across two machines and epochs (3054 and 3055), demonstrating the complete startup process and proving job execution in a rollup architecture.

## Job Types Observed

### 1. TUBE_PROOF
- **Purpose**: Initial proof generation for individual transactions or operations
- **Completion Time**: Fast (typically under 1-2 seconds)
- **Pattern**: Multiple TUBE_PROOFs complete before triggering downstream jobs
- **Volume**: High parallelism (20+ concurrent jobs in epoch 3055)

### 2. PUBLIC_VM (New in epoch 3055)
- **Purpose**: Public virtual machine circuit proofs for transaction execution
- **Completion Time**: Variable (processing AVM circuits for individual TXs)
- **Pattern**: Processes specific transaction hashes
- **Details**: Shows actual TX processing with specific transaction IDs

### 3. PUBLIC_BASE_ROLLUP
- **Purpose**: Aggregates TUBE_PROOFs into base rollup proofs
- **Completion Time**: Moderate (2-3 seconds typically)
- **Pattern**: Created after TUBE_PROOF completions
- **Witness Generation**: ~3.2 seconds with 552KB input, 1.17KB output

### 4. MERGE_ROLLUP
- **Purpose**: Higher-level aggregation of PUBLIC_BASE_ROLLUP proofs
- **Completion Time**: Variable (3-5 seconds)
- **Pattern**: Created after PUBLIC_BASE_ROLLUP completions

## System Startup Process (B Machine - Epoch 3055)

### Initialization Sequence
1. **CRS Download**: Grumpkin CRS (262,145 size) and main CRS (33,554,433 size)
2. **Component Setup**: BB prover and ACVM initialization
3. **Server Start**: Aztec Server listening on port 8080
4. **Job Queue Activation**: Immediate start of proving jobs

### Hierarchical Proving Structure

## Comparative Analysis

### Epoch 3054 (A Machine) - Timing: 10:03:26 - 10:03:50
- **Total Duration**: ~24 seconds
- **TUBE_PROOF Jobs**: 8 completed
- **PUBLIC_BASE_ROLLUP Jobs**: 6 completed, 3 new created
- **MERGE_ROLLUP Jobs**: 4 completed, 3 new created

### Epoch 3055 (B Machine) - Timing: 10:17:47 - 10:17:54+
- **Startup Duration**: ~2 seconds (from init to first jobs)
- **TUBE_PROOF Jobs**: 20+ started simultaneously
- **PUBLIC_VM Jobs**: 17+ AVM circuit proofs
- **PUBLIC_BASE_ROLLUP Jobs**: 1+ with witness generation

### Performance Metrics

- **Witness Generation**: 3.2s (552KB input → 1.17KB output)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all jobs completed on first attempt)

## Transaction Processing Details (Epoch 3055)

### AVM Circuit Proofs
The system processes individual transactions through AVM (Aztec Virtual Machine) circuits:
- **Sample Transactions**: 
  - `0x0e9d6d97941680e05f89e848c81f561c7d6dd5ab5629a9846708d9c3693507c6`
  - `0x29f9738af1c609f733db8862a3e751ea6ecf3181412f476e94e0ea0490b771d0`
  - [14+ more unique transaction hashes]
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple TX proofs running simultaneously
- **Integration**: AVM proofs feed into the broader rollup structure

## Key Observations

1. **No Failed Jobs**: All jobs show `totalAttempts=1`, indicating efficient proving without retries
2. **Parallel Processing**: Massive parallelism (20+ TUBE_PROOF, 17+ PUBLIC_VM jobs)
3. **Cross-Epoch Consistency**: Similar patterns between epochs 3054 and 3055
4. **Unique Job IDs**: Each job has a unique hash identifier
5. **Fast Startup**: System becomes operational within 2 seconds of initialization
6. **Transaction Visibility**: Epoch 3055 shows actual transaction hash processing

## System Health Indicators

✅ **Healthy Signs:**
- No retry attempts needed
- Consistent timing patterns
- Proper job progression through hierarchy
- No error messages or timeouts

## Recommendations

### Monitoring & Alerting
1. **Job Health**: Monitor for retry patterns (totalAttempts > 1)
2. **Performance Trends**: Track completion time trends for regression detection
3. **Stuck Jobs**: Alert on jobs without completion messages
4. **Startup Health**: Monitor CRS download times and initialization duration

### Metrics & Optimization
1. **Throughput Tracking**: Jobs/second per job type (especially HIGH_VOLUME TUBE_PROOF)
2. **Resource Utilization**: Monitor parallel job execution capacity
3. **Witness Generation**: Track input/output size ratios and timing
4. **Cross-Epoch Comparison**: Compare performance metrics between epochs

### Operational Insights
1. **Capacity Planning**: System handles 20+ parallel TUBE_PROOF jobs efficiently
2. **Network Considerations**: Large CRS downloads (33MB+) on startup
3. **Transaction Throughput**: 17+ concurrent AVM circuit proofs indicate high TX volume
4. **Multi-Machine Coordination**: Both machines operating on consecutive epochs successfully
